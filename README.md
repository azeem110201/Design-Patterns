# Adapter Design Pattern

Adapter Design Pattern is used to wraps one of the objects to hide the complexity of conversion happening behind the scenes.
They are used in cases where we have different interface and we need to conclude our results in one interface.
The best example is working with XML and JSON data. As both these format has different reading and writing code, we need to create a single interface so that we can read data
either in JSON or XML form.
